# Overview

An online petition built with Handlebars.js where supporters can register/login, add/update profile information,
sign the petition, redo the petition and view a list of fellow signers sorted by location.

The cause for this particular petition advocates bringing a sequel of the film the Big Lebowski back to the big screen.

This project was built during the course "Full Stack Web Development" at SPICED Academy Berlin.
I really enjoyed it since it gave me the opportunity to practice SQL queries and deepen my understanding of frontend-backend data flow.
